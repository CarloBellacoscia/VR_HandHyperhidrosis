# MSc Thesis Repository: VR-based training simulator of thoracoscopic surgery for palmar hyperhidrosis

## Overview

This repository contains the full codebase, data, and supplementary materials for my MSc thesis in Computer Engineering, titled **"VR-based training simulator of thoracoscopic surgery for palmar hyperhidrosis"**. The thesis was completed at "Politecnico di Milano" under the supervision of Professor Marco Gribaudo. The objective of this research is to develop a laparoscopic surgery simulator in virtual reality (VR), including the creation of the corresponding three-dimensional (3D) models in Blender and the management of the entire simulation in Unity with scripting in C#. The logic allows for the tracking of user input and position, as well as error and time spent metrics. This is achieved using affordable simulators such as Meta Quest 2, which addresses the current lack of affordable, user-friendly simulators in this field.
